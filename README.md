# Processor emulator
To understand microcontroller systems and CPU architectures in detail, I am trying to make an emulator of a multi-core processor using Python language. I focus on extendabiliy of a code, easy reuse and simplicity. 
As I also want to learn more about OOP, this task is almost ideal to practice with.

# Goals
  * Functional single-core model
  * Functional multi-core model
  * Easy to add new instructions
  * Pipelining
  * RISC-V compatibility
